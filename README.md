# pmTracer
**Poor Man's Tracer** is a very simple and minimal ray tracing and path tracing library.

It is based on the theory and the code of [_Ray Tracing from the Ground Up_](http://www.raytracegroundup.com/) by Kevin Suffern.

The library is just a way to learn the concepts explained in the book. It is neither fast, nor correct nor complete.
